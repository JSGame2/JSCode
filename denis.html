   <h1> <b> <center> About Denis Khavin </center> </b> </h1>
   <h2> MOGUL TALK ALERT </h2>
   <p> On October 28, 2000, a straight up savage was born.
	 His name was Denis Khavin.
	 Denis has accomplished many things throughout his life.
	 He has bought a family of donkeys in Africa,
	 he has beaten Gronk in a tight end battle and
	 he has won his elementary school's bingo competition....twice.
	 He listens to Jamaican music in the shower
	 and chills with his boy Whiteside courtside at Heat games. </p>
