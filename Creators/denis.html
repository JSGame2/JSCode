   <h1> <b> <center> About Denis Khavin </center> </b>
   <h2> MOGUL TALK ALERT </h2>
   On October 28, 2000, a straight up savage was born.  His name was Denis Khavin.  Denis has accomplished many things throughout his life.  He has bought a family of donkeys in Africa, he has beaten Gronk in a tight end battle and he has won his elementary school's bingo competition....twice.  He listens to Jamaican music in the shower and chills with his boy Whiteside courtside at Heat games.
